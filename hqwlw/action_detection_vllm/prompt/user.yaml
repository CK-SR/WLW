  Study the person in this image crop and choose the single best action label from the allowed set.
  If the view is unclear, pick the closest plausible label and explain why.
  Answer strictly with minified JSON using the schema:
  {"class_id": <int>, "class_name": "<label>", "confidence": <float 0-1>, "rationale": "<brief justification>"}
  Keep the rationale concise (<=40 words). Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON.
  Reference cues for each label:
  - 0 smoking: fingers near the mouth or a clearly held cigarette.
  - 1 calling: a hand placed against the ear as if holding a phone.
  - 2 climb: the person is climbing a wall, window, or similar vertical surface.
  - 3 jump: arms swinging up or down with a crouched or airborne posture.
  - 4 run: vigorous arm swings with rapid, crossing strides that signal sprinting.
  - 5 takephoto: phone held up in front of the face with raised arms.
  - 6 walk: movement is slow or moderate with relaxed limbs, lacking jump or run intensity.
  - 7 carry: the person is holding or hugging a box or other noticeable item while moving.
